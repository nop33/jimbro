# Jimbro - my personal gym workout tracking app

After more than a decade in web dev, I am suffering from framework fatigue. This project is an experiment and challenge for myself to build an app using only what the browser, HTML, and CSS can provide me (with the exception of TypeScript. I still want TypeScript. Oh, and TailWind because I haven't tried that out yet).

- No routing, simple index.html files
- No frameworks. Just JavaScript (well, TypeScript).
- No depedencies (except TailWind)
